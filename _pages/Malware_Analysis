## Author

My name is Diego Messiah, I am a teaching enthusiast and problem solver.

After many years i worked as a Graphic Designer for clients around the world in one of my trips I met a friend of the family who is dedicated to Computer Security in Banks.

Its was simple, I had fallen in love with this profession, I dusted off my old notes on operating systems, took networking courses and accreditations that would allow me to enter this world.

After a year I found myself in a middle Cloud Computing Service Provider Company where I had to support all the IT systems (Servers, Desktop, Phones, Virtualization, ...), take care of the helpdesk tickets, resolve complicate and urgent issues, etc...

I was intrigued by how to automate my work, convert those long hours preparing reports in a couple of clicks, in short time Powershell is converted in my principal tool. 

This experience and passion for automation lead me to work close to the CISO, since then I started down the Security Information path.

This blog is about scripting and automatization, enjoy.


## Open Source projects

Most of my public projects are available [on Github](https://github.com/diegomessiah). It worth mentionning that I also have a small dedicated page on this blog: "[projects](/p/scripts.html)" (small subset).
